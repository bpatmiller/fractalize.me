## Fractalize.me

### What is this?
Given an input image, this program breaks the image up into smaller components and then calculates and renders a julia set that approximates each small component.

### How do I use it?
Compile the .java files with javac, put a png in the in/ directory, and run Fractalize.class. This project was done in pure Java, so it has no weird dependencies.
